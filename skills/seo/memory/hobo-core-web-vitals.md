## Core Concept
Hobo frames Core Web Vitals as both direct ranking-change inputs and indirect behaviour-shaping signals, where poor performance causes the bad clicks that stronger ranking systems later punish.

## Key Takeaways
- The leak contains explicit storage models for CWV field data, which confirms Google ingests these metrics rather than merely recommending them.
- Hobo highlights a specific `VoltPerDocData` model whose stated purpose is that the data is used for ranking changes.
- CWV matters because it affects user behaviour. Slow or unstable pages create frustration, which then produces `badClicks` and downstream demotions.
- Page experience is not isolated from quality. Hobo ties CWV to trust, helpfulness, and human page-quality judgments.
- The system also tracks HTTPS and keeps mobile and desktop experience distinct, reinforcing that technical quality is contextual.
- Freshness, page regions, and `contentEffort` appear alongside these experience systems, showing Google evaluates usability inside a larger quality architecture.

## Frameworks/Methods Covered
- **Preventive UX model**: improve CWV to prevent negative behavioural signals
- **Page experience buffer**: HTTPS + mobile friendliness + no intrusive interstitials + CWV
- **Trust gateway**: poor technical experience blocks E-E-A-T from being perceived

## Data/Stats
- Published: October 24, 2025
- Key attributes discussed: `lcp`, `inp`, `cls`, `fid`, `mobileCwv`, `desktopCwv`, `displayUrlIsHttps`
- Hobo highlights Google’s use of 75th percentile field data aligned with CrUX-style measurement

## How The Team Should Use This
- **Coral (SEO)**: Treat CWV fixes as ranking defense, not just reporting hygiene.
- **Plankton (Writer)**: Put key information early because Google may truncate long pages and users bounce fast on slow pages.
- **Developer / Chitin**: Prioritize LCP, INP, and CLS on templates that receive search traffic first, especially mobile layouts.
- **Current (Marketing)**: Avoid campaigns to pages that deliver poor technical experiences because paid awareness cannot compensate for search dissatisfaction signals.
- **Key insight for the team**: CWV is valuable not because it is a checklist, but because it prevents measurable dissatisfaction.
