## Core Concept
The 2024 Google Content Warehouse API leak + the DOJ antitrust trial combined to reveal Google's actual ranking blueprint — not theory, not reverse engineering. This is the foundational document for all post-leak SEO strategy. Shaun Anderson's decoded analysis: "We're not reverse-engineering. We're reading the blueprints."

## Key Takeaways
- The leak exposed Google's actual internal data structures, ranking signals, and pipeline — unprecedented
- NavBoost is confirmed: user clicks and interactions directly influence rankings — CTR is a real ranking signal
- Google's ranking is a **multi-stage pipeline**, not a single algorithm pass
- The leak validates E-E-A-T as a genuine scoring system, not just a guideline
- "From pleasing to proving" — the new SEO mandate is demonstrating authority with evidence, not keyword optimization
- The DOJ trial added further confirmation of how Google's quality systems work in practice
- This changes SEO from guesswork to blueprint execution

## Core Data Structures (from the leak)
- **CompositeDoc** — Google's core document data structure (all signals combined per URL)
- **PerDocData** — per-document ranking data stored by Google
- **QualityNsrPQData** — the core page quality assessment object
- **CompressedQualitySignals** — compressed quality signals applied at ranking time
- **NavBoost** — click/interaction signal system that adjusts rankings based on user behavior

## Ranking Pipeline (multi-stage)
1. Crawl + index (document ingestion)
2. Quality scoring (QualityNsrPQData, CompressedQualitySignals)
3. NavBoost adjustment (user interaction signals layered on top)
4. Final ranking (composite of all signals)

## Signal Taxonomy (from the leak)
- **User signals**: clicks, dwell time, bounce rate (NavBoost)
- **Content signals**: topicality, comprehensiveness, freshness
- **Authority signals**: E-E-A-T, domain quality score (Q*)
- **Technical signals**: Core Web Vitals, mobile, structured data
- **Link signals**: still present but filtered through quality lens

## The New Strategic Playbook
- Old SEO: optimize for keywords, build links, rank
- Post-leak SEO: demonstrate expertise with evidence, earn user engagement, build topical authority
- "Prove it" — every claim needs supporting evidence (E-E-A-T is enforced algorithmically)
- User engagement (NavBoost) means content must genuinely satisfy searchers, not just rank

## Data/Stats
- Word count: 6,002 words
- 14 external links
- 98 internal links
- Published post-HCU (Helpful Content Update) era

## How The Team Should Use This
- **Coral (SEO)**: Every content brief should be built against this blueprint — topicality, E-E-A-T signals, NavBoost optimization (compelling titles/meta for CTR)
- **Chitin (Dev)**: Technical signals from the leak inform site architecture decisions — Core Web Vitals, structured data, crawl efficiency
- **Plankton (Writer)**: "Prove it" principle — every article needs evidence, examples, data. No thin assertions
- **Current (Marketing)**: NavBoost = user engagement = rankings. Content that gets shares and return visits sends positive NavBoost signals
- **@learnaiwithvijay**: AI content niche + E-E-A-T evidence + strong CTR optimization = the formula for AI Overview citations AND organic rankings

## Canonical Synthesis

This canonical note is reinforced by 1 merge candidate(s) and 1 supporting note(s) in the local memory library.

### Supporting Note Digest
- `hobo-perdocdata.md`: PerDocData is Google's core per-document data structure revealed in the Content Warehouse leak — it's the "Rosetta Stone" of how Google evaluates every individual document, encompassing authority, semantic understanding, click signals, freshness, and spam demotions in a single model.
- `hobo-google-updates-mapping.md`: This Hobo article maps famous Google updates to specific leaked attributes and systems, turning years of SEO lore into a more concrete architecture of penalties, boosts, and quality modules.

### Retrieval Guidance
- Start with this note for the topic baseline and open the supporting notes only when you need source-specific evidence or edge cases.
- Use the attached digest to avoid re-reading overlapping notes during planning and research.

## Evidence Fusion

Evidence confidence: medium
Freshness status: current
Distinct sources: Hobo

### Cross-Source Signals
- **Hobo**: The 2024 Google Content Warehouse API leak + the DOJ antitrust trial combined to reveal Google's actual ranking blueprint — not theory, not reverse engineering. This is the foundational document for all post-leak SEO strategy. Shaun Anderson's decoded analysis: "We're not reverse-engineering. We're reading the blueprints.".

### Consensus
- Sources converge that `ranking architecture` should be treated as a repeatable operating concern, not a one-off tactic.
- Recurring signals across the evidence set: google leak, ranking signals.

### Tension / Caveat
- No strong source conflict stands out in the current evidence set; the supporting notes mostly add nuance rather than contradict the primary canon.

### Squad Action
- Use the canonical note first, then open supporting evidence only when you need source-specific proof, edge cases, or fresher platform behavior.
