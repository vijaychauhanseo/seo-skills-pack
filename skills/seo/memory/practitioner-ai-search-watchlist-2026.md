# Practitioner Watchlist for AI Search Diagnostics

## Core Concept
Practitioners are the edge-case layer of the library. They often surface behavior, timelines, and measurement quirks before the official docs explain them cleanly.

## Highest-Signal Practitioner Patterns
- Glenn Gabe's June and July 2025 work reinforced that AI Overviews and AI Mode move with Google's broader quality and ranking systems. If a site loses quality signals in core updates, AI visibility can drop with it, and AI Search traffic is still too small for most sites to justify ignoring Google Search.
- Marie Haynes highlighted that the September 11, 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines update added examples where raters assess AI Overviews directly. That matters because AI answers are being evaluated as part of the user experience, not as something outside of Search quality.
- Marie's running algorithm and AI-feature timeline is one of the best sources for exact launch and rollout dates when people get fuzzy about what changed and when.
- Brodie Clark's experiments clarified that AI Mode data started appearing in Search Console around June 13, 2025 and that AI-feature reporting remains lossy and appearance-dependent.
- iPullRank's GEO framing maps AI search to probabilistic retrieval, synthetic subqueries, and passage selection. That matches the DEJAN lens: winning is about inclusion across retrieval paths, not only rank for the head term.
- Patrick Stox is the data-reality layer: AI traffic share, GSC blind spots, AI-search conversion quality, AI Mode ranking experiments, and AIO placement behavior.
- Cindy Krum is the SERP-observation layer: Fraggles, mobile rendering, passage-like section visibility, and screenshot-first testing of what users actually see.
- Lily Ray is the trust-and-quality layer: AI Overview tracking gaps, quality-system interpretation, inaccurate AIOs, and hands-on Gemini RAG inspection.

## How To Combine This Layer
- Pair Glenn Gabe with Hobo when the problem looks like core quality, update sensitivity, or AI-surface losses after a broader quality hit.
- Pair Marie Haynes with official Google guidance when the problem looks like quality, reputation, rollout timing, or rater-style evaluation.
- Pair Brodie Clark with Search Engine Roundtable when the issue is Search Console reporting or feature measurement.
- Pair iPullRank with DEJAN when the issue is query fan-out, retrieval breadth, or why lower-ranking pages get selected into AI answers.
- Pair Patrick Stox with Ahrefs when the issue is metrics, benchmarks, or whether AI-search impact is materially visible yet.
- Pair Cindy Krum with DEJAN when the issue is passage selection, fragment visibility, or mobile SERP presentation.
- Pair Lily Ray with official Google guidance when the issue is trust, AI Overview quality, structured data, or how Google messaging compares with field reality.

## How The Team Should Use This
- Pinchy: use practitioners for fast pattern detection and reality checks when the ecosystem is shifting.
- Coral: use them when traffic, citations, or answer inclusion do not match rank-based expectations.
- Kelp: use this layer to collect timelines, experiments, and failure modes that official docs will not spell out.

## Evidence Fusion

Evidence confidence: medium
Freshness status: current
Distinct sources: Ahrefs

### Cross-Source Signals
- **Ahrefs**: Practitioners are the edge-case layer of the library. They often surface behavior, timelines, and measurement quirks before the official docs explain them cleanly.

### Consensus
- Sources converge that `ai search practitioners` should be treated as a repeatable operating concern, not a one-off tactic.

### Tension / Caveat
- No strong source conflict stands out in the current evidence set; the supporting notes mostly add nuance rather than contradict the primary canon.

### Squad Action
- Use the canonical note first, then open supporting evidence only when you need source-specific proof, edge cases, or fresher platform behavior.
