# Curated SEO Source Canon for AI Search and Technical SEO

## Core Concept
Do not "train the model" with random internet scraping. Build a curated source stack. For our squad, the right structure is three layers: official rules, publication studies, and practitioner diagnostics.

## The 3-Layer Source Stack

### 1. Official Rules
Start with Google Search Central when the task is about eligibility, technical requirements, structured data, spam-policy boundaries, or what Google has actually confirmed.

Canonical local note:
- `google-search-central-ai-features-2026.md`

### 2. Publication Studies And Monitoring
Use Ahrefs, Search Engine Land, and Search Engine Roundtable when the task is about current studies, benchmarks, reporting behavior, workflow norms, and short-cycle ecosystem changes.

Canonical local note:
- `industry-ai-search-monitoring-2026.md`

### 3. Practitioner Diagnostics
Use DEJAN, Glenn Gabe, Marie Haynes, Brodie Clark, iPullRank, Patrick Stox, Cindy Krum, and Lily Ray when the task is about weird behavior, timelines, edge cases, Search Console quirks, query fan-out, passage selection, reverse engineering, or quality-system interpretation.

Canonical local notes:
- `practitioner-ai-search-watchlist-2026.md`
- `dejan-ai-reverse-engineering-pack.md`

## Decision Rule
- Need the official answer: start with Google.
- Need a market benchmark or large external study: start with Ahrefs or the industry monitoring note.
- Need a fast rollout confirmation: check Search Engine Roundtable, Marie's timeline, or Brodie's experiments.
- Need to understand whether an AI visibility drop is really a core-quality problem: check Glenn Gabe.
- Need metrics on whether AI-search changes matter in practice: check Patrick Stox.
- Need SERP-surface or fragment-level observation: check Cindy Krum.
- Need trust, AIO quality, or Gemini/RAG inspection: check Lily Ray.
- Need to explain why a page ranks but is not selected into AI answers: use DEJAN plus practitioner notes.
- Need to decide what to ingest next: prefer sources that improve our retrieval and judgment, not generic SEO noise.

## Training Rule For The Squad
- Curated web content teaches the squad what strong SEO operators know.
- Our own labeled wins, losses, before-after rewrites, and citation outcomes should teach the squad how we win.
- That means source expansion comes before any true model fine-tuning, and internal labeled cases matter more than broad web volume.

## Recommended Core Bundle
- `google-search-central-ai-features-2026.md`
- `industry-ai-search-monitoring-2026.md`
- `practitioner-ai-search-watchlist-2026.md`
- `dejan-ai-reverse-engineering-pack.md`
- `ahrefs-ai-visibility-guide.md`
- `hobo-google-leak-decoded.md`

## How The Team Should Use This
- Pinchy: use this as the router when deciding which intelligence layer to activate.
- Coral: use it to avoid mixing official rules, studies, and experiments into one blurry recommendation.
- Kelp: use it to expand the library deliberately instead of scraping everything.
- Current: use it when leaders ask what matters now versus what is just industry chatter.
